This document highlights an in depth analysis of the performance of schools in the district. 
It looks at reading and math scores per school, as well as budgets per student, and then stratifies these findings by size of school, budget, and type of school. 
One of the most interesting findings is that the best performing schools have the lowest budget per student. The scores consistently got lower as the budget per student increased.
Another interesting finding is that the small schools had the best scores throughout, save for the overall passing score which was sligbtly edged out by medium sized schools.
